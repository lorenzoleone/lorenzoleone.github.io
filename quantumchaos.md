The theory of quantum chaos is elusive to characterize. In classical chaos, a chaotic dynamics suffer high sensitivity to initial condition. A phenomenon known as [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). In quantum unitary dynamics, different initial states cannot lead to an exponential separation of trajectories, as a trivial consequence of the conservation of the inner product between states.  A quantum version of the butterfly effect means that the chaotic unitary dynamics spread the operator throughout the systems in a way that measuring a local operator has a non-trivial effect on the measurement of a spatially separated local operator. This corresponds to the decay of the Out-of-Time-Order Correlations (OTOCs) functions, whose general expression is:

$$\operatorname{OTOC}_2_k=\frac{1}{d}\operatorname{tr}(A_1(t)B_1A_2(t)B_2\cdots A_{k}(t)B_{k})$$


Waiting for a more satisfactory definition of quantum chaos, I define a unitary operator U to be chaotic if it attains a Haar value for general multi-point (2k) OTOCs, i.e. the value that would be reached by a generic unitary operator.
