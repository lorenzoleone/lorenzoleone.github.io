I am a Ph.D. student whose main interest is the investigation of cutting-edge quantum theory. I am particularly interested in understanding the nature of quantum complexity, the onset of quantum chaos, and the interplay between quantum complexity and quantum advantage. My research combines tools from quantum information theory, many-body physics, and mathematical physics.
