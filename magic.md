Quantum computers are more powerful than classical computer. They provide an overwhelming speed-up, the so-called quantum advantage, on certein computational tasks. Two quantum resources are responsible for the quantum advantage, magic and entanglement. It is a striking fact that these two resources can be hierercarized from the point of view of quantum complexity. Indeed, entanglement can be created by means of unitary operators belonging to a subgroup of the unitary group, the Clifford group. States created by the action of the Clifford group on computational basis states are called stabilizer states. This special class of states admits a efficient classical representation and, as a consequence, quantum computation emplying stabilizer states only can be efficiently reproduced by classical computers. Therefore, although these states are highly entangled, they lack computational power.

To unlock quantum advantage one needs non-Clifford gates. States created with non-Clifford gates are said to possess magic.
