Quantum computers are more powerful than classical computer. They provide an overwhelming speed-up, the so-called quantum advantage, on certein computational tasks. Two quantum resources are responsible for the quantum advantage, magic and entanglement. It is a striking fact that these two resources can be hierercarized from the point of view of quantum complexity. Indeed, entanglement can be created by means of unitary operators belonging to a subgroup of the unitary group, the Clifford group. States created by the action of the Clifford group on computational basis states are called stabilizer states. This special class of states admits a efficient classical representation and, as a consequence, quantum computation emplying stabilizer states only can be efficiently reproduced by classical computers. Therefore, although these states are highly entangled, they lack computational power. To unlock quantum advantage one needs non-Clifford gates. States created by some non-Clifford gates are said to possess magic.

Magic state resource theory has been widely employed for the problem of classical simulation of quantum dynamics. Clearly, quantum computation that can be efficiently reproduced classically cannot afford any quantum advantage. The question is: how many non-Clifford gates are, at least, necessary to achieve quantum advantage? The answer can be found in, where Bravyi and Gosset proved that the classical simulations of Clifford circuits doped with \\(t\\) non-Clifford gates is polynomially in the number of qubits \\(n\\), and exponential in \\(t\\). Thus, states created by, at least, \\(O(n)\\) non-Clifford gates can achieve a quantum speed-up.

We introduced a novel measure of magic in terms of an entropic quantity, the Stabilizer Rènyi entropy. We show that a family of magic measure is obtained by the Rènyi entropies of the probability distribution given by the expectation value of Pauli strings. Let \\(\mathbb{P}\\) the set of all Pauli string, then:

$$ \Xi(P):=d $$
How does the magic scale with the number \\(t\\) of non-Clifford gates injected in the circuits?
